#ADO.NET DAL

An assembly designed to provide all the normal ADO.Net commands but to take make some of the activities
that you usually have to worry about a lot easier, such as connectivity to the database.

The API is designed around an interfact to make it easy to use with dependency injection.

##Why?

This is assembly is one of my "ToolBelt" pieces of code that I've had knocking around for about 5 years.
I decided to dust it off, update it and then put it on GitHub so I always have access to it and if other
people find it useful they can use it as well.
